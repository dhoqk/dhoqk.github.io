####Step 4: Setting up instance for node.js install

If you have followed general outlines up to step 3, then you should have your terminal open.  If you haven't please do so now.

Following steps were borrowed from Kostas MAVROPALIAS [blog](http://iconof.com/blog/how-to-install-setup-node-js-on-amazon-aws-ec2-complete-guide){:target="_blank"}  

>Before we begin, there are couple of linux commands you should familiarize.

>`ls` lists files in the directory

>
>`cd ..` move up one directory
>
>`cd \` move to root directory

>`lsblk` list block drives
>
>`sudo su` change to superuser so you won't have to type 'sudo' in front everytime

>`rm` to remove file or directory, ex: `rm -rf mydirectory`

Getting packages necessary for compiling node.js and clone from git.  
In terminal:

{% highlight bash %}
sudo yum install gcc-c++ make
sudo yum install openssl-devel
sudo yum install git
git clone git://github.com/joyent/node.git
{% endhighlight %}

After installing node.js we are installing [Express](http://expressjs.com/) for web framework.  As of today, Jan 17, 2015, most **current and stable** version of node.js was v0.10.9.  Type `git tag -l` from terminal to see list of all versions. If there are later versions just replace the version number following 'checkout' command on the bottom.  Node.js follows versioning schema of "even numbers = stable". So, v0.10.x are stable and v0.11.x are not.
Back in terminal:

{% highlight bash %}
git checkout v0.10.9
./configure
make
sudo make install
{% endhighlight %}

If your are familiar with Vi text editor:
>in vi, use
>
>`i` for input
>
>esc key to exit out of input mode
>
>`:wq!` to write, save, and quit


{% highlight bash %}
sudo vi /etc/sudoers
    #find the line that has:
    #Defaults    secure_path = /sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
    #and add at the end. After '/urs/bin'
:/usr/local/bin
{% endhighlight %}

If you are not familiar with vi use nano text editor.
{% highlight bash %}
sudo nano /etc/sudoers
    #it should open up text editor within terminal
    #use arrow keys to navigate to line that has:
Defaults    secure_path = /sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
    #and add the follwoing at the end of the line after "/usr/bin"
:/usr/local/bin
    #hit control x (to save and exit)
    #overwrite? yes
    #file name sudoers? enter
{% endhighlight %}

Next we need to install node package manager NPM.
{% highlight bash %}
git clone https://github.com/isaacs/npm.git
cd npm
sudo make install
{% endhighlight %}

If it gives you an error at "sudo make install" try again to force install.  Or try using `sudo make install -g`

Next we are going to install Express (web framework) and Forever (so, node server is running all the time) via npm.

{% highlight bash %}
sudo npm install express -g
sudo npm install forever -g
{% endhighlight %}

And this creates Express application skeleton.

{% highlight bash %}
sudo npm install express-generator -g
{% endhighlight %}

This lists command options.

{% highlight bash %}
express -h
{% endhighlight %}

And that's it for installing node.js and npm.  However, you still need to install Express and mongoDB on EBS volume.
