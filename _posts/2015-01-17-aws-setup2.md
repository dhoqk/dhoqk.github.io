###Install Express data on EBS volume

<!--more-->
If you followed the general guidelines up to step 3 in the first section, you should've created, attached and mounted EBS volume on **/mnt/my-data**

We are going to follow guides from [Express](http://expressjs.com/starter/generator.html) website.  In terminal browse to directory you want your web application to be created.

For example the following will create `myapp`, web application skeleton, under **/mnt/my-data**.  If you want to install it under different directory change 

{% highlight bash %}
cd mnt/my-data
{% endhighlight %}

from belowe to anything you want.

In terminal:

{% highlight bash %}
cd /
cd mnt/my-data
sudo express myapp
{% endhighlight %}

Now install dependencies:

{% highlight bash %}
cd myapp && npm install
{% endhighlight %}

And run this to debug (not necessary):

{% highlight bash %}
DEBUG=myapp ./bin/www
{% endhighlight %}

Now let's create first app.
Open any text editor, copy and paste this code and save it as app.js.
{% highlight javascript %}
var express = require('express')
var app = express()

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Hello World!')
})

var server = app.listen(3000, function () {

  var host = server.address().address
  var port = server.address().port

  console.log('Example app listening at http://%s:%s', host, port)

})
{% endhighlight %}

###Open Port 3000 in AWS EC2

Before we go any further you should make sure port 3000 is open for EC2 instance.

1. Go to EC2 console and click on security groups.
2. Choose the security group you are using.
3. Click on Actions and Edit Inbound Rules.
4. From popup window click on Add rule.
5. From pull down menu, highlight Custom TCP Rule and change Port Range to 3000.
6. Source should be from anywhere.
7. Click Save.

##Open your FTP program or download Filezilla from [here](http://www.filezilla.com).##

1. Follow instructions [here](http://dhoqk.github.io/filezilla-configuration.md) to setup.
2. Once connected to your server via filezilla, browse to your directory 'myapp' (right-side window is your server).
3. From left-side window, browse to where you saved 'app.js' and copy it over to server directory 'myapp' by right clicking on file and uploading.

>When you are looking at the right-side of the window look at file name and 'permissions'.
>If you see all dashes like so ------- then we have to change permissions from SSH.
>Back to terminal, and type this:
>
>{% highlight bash %}
>cd /
>sudo chmod -R 755 path_to_myapp
>#path_to_myapp should be something like "mnt/my-data/myapp"
>{% endhighlight %}
>Refresh Filezilla files (there's a littl icon at top) and make sure permissions for >app.js looks something like this
>-rwxr-xr-x-

###Test on browser and configure port fowarding

From your browser:

{% highlight bash %}
http://yourdomain.com:3000
{% endhighlight %}

You should get a response with "Hello World".  If you don't make sure you have opened port 3000 from EC2 instance and saved it.

Getting the response is all good and all, but you don't want your users to type ":3000" everytime they connect to your website.  We need port forwarding for that.

Open terminal again and type this:

{% highlight bash %}
#Press Control-C if myapp is still listening on port 3000 to return to command prompt
sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 3000
{% endhighlight %}

This will successfully redirect the HTTP/HTTPS request, which is listening on port 80, to 3000.  Why do this instead of changing the code to listen to 80?  Because, you don't want your process to be running on root.  If hackers found out that your service is running on 80 they can cause mayhem to your server.  And Express/Node.JS will throw an exception if you try to use 80.  Well, at least, it did it to me.

Now, rerun your app from terminal.

{% highlight bash %}
sudo node myapp.js
{% endhighlight %}

Make sure it says it's listening on port 3000.
From your browser go to _yourdomain.com_.

You should again see "Hello World!".

###Run app Forever
We should have npm forever installed already, but if you don't please install it now by:

{% highlight bash %}
#hit control-c to quit myapp.js
cd /
sudo npm install forever -g
{% endhighlight %}
or to check if you have it installed
{% highlight bash %}
#hit control-c to quit myapp.js
cd /
forever -v
{% endhighlight %}
This will list all the options you can use for forever.

If you kill myapp.js or if it terminates then your app will not be able to answer http requests sent from other users.  To see what I mean, hit `control-c` if myapp.js is still running and try to visit your website.  Most likely you will get an error.  To fix this  we need to run forever so your app will run in background and restart automatically even if it fails.

In terminal:
{% highlight bash %}
#hit control-c to quit myapp.js, if you haven't already.
#browse to your app folder.  Like so: mnt/my-data
forever start myapp.js
#you might get a warning saying minUpTime and spinSleepTime is not set. And return you to command promp.  Indicating that forever is running in background.  Don't have to hit "Control-C" anymore.
forever list
#this will list all the processes that are handled by forever.
#you should see something like:
info:    Forever processes running
data:        uid  command             script     forever pid   id logfile                 uptime       
data:    [0] Fer3 /usr/local/bin/node xxxxxx.js 13831   13833    /root/.forever/Fer3.log 0:0:0:27.367
#Or use 
ps axl | grep node
#which will show something like
0     0 14285     1  20   0 662376 21520 ep_pol Ssl  ?          0:00 /usr/local/bin/node /usr/local/lib/node_modules/forever/bin/monitor xxxxx.js
0     0 14295 14285  20   0 661512 19420 ep_pol Sl   ?          0:00 /usr/local/bin/node /mnt/xxxx/xxxxx/xxxxxx.js
0     0 14329 14022  20   0 110284   624 -      R+   pts/0      0:00 grep node
#notice testapp.js is running on two processes.
#if for any reason you want to stop both process kill both pids ex: kill 14285 & kill 14295
{% endhighlight %}

Now browse to your website.

You should see "Hello World!" again.

To test if this will really run forever:
{% highlight bash %}
#use process id not forever pid
kill 13833 
#and then
forever list
{% endhighlight %}

Notice that process id has changed, 13833 to new one, but, not forever pid.  Indicating process has terminated but ran again automatically.

Now we are going to write a script and configure crontab, so when EC2 instance reboots it will execute our app automatically on reboot.

Tell the crontab to run script on reboot:

{% highlight bash %}
crontab -e
#this should open with blank page, press "i" and copy the line belowe to it
PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/aws/bin:/home/ec2-user/bin
#Set PATH variable so it knows where to look for node.js and our app
@reboot sleep 60; /usr/local/bin/forever start /mnt/my-data/myapp.js && sh /mnt/my-data/bootScript.sh >> /mnt/my-data/bootScript_output.log 2>&1
#make sure you change your directories accordingly.  Here we tell the instance to sleep for 60 seconds to make sure EBS mounts before executing our script.  We are also executing a script called bootScript.sh that we haven't created yet and also logs any errors or system outputs we may have to bootScript_output.log.
#Hit "esc" to exit editing mode and type ":wq!" to save and quit.
#From terminal:
sudo nano /mnt/my-data/bootScript.sh
#this creates the script.  Copy the following line to the text editor and save
sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 3000
#again this configures iptables so it redirects the port 80 to 3000.  Hit control x and save.
{% endhighlight %}

Now we are done! To test if it works, do this from terminal:

{% highlight bash %}
crontab -l
#this should show something like:
#PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/aws/bin:/home/ec2-user/bin
#@reboot sleep 60; /usr/local/bin/forever start /mnt/my-data/myapp.js && sh /mnt/my-data/bootScript.sh >> /mnt/my-data/bootScript_output.log 2>&1
#if it does 
sudo reboot
#let the instance reboot and wait about 2 min.
{% endhighlight %}

Open your browser and go to #your_domain.com#.
You should be able to see Hello World again.

Hopefully everything went well and now we should have an EC2 instance with node.js installed and EBS volume to hold persistant data.  We also have forever to rerun our app if node.js kills the process and crontab to fire up forever if the instance fails.

This was my very first blogging attempt, so please be patient with me.  I tried to make this as easy as possbile, but if I came short please be kind and understanding.
