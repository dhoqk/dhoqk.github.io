###Install Express data on EBS volume

<!--more-->
If you have followed the general guidelines step 3 you should have created, attached and mounted EBS volume on **/mnt/my-data**

We are going to follow guides from [Express](http://expressjs.com/starter/generator.html) website.  In terminal browse to directory you want your web application to be created.

For example the following will create `myapp`, web application skeleton, under **/mnt/my-data**.  If you want to install it under different directory change 

```bash
cd mnt/my-data
```
from belowe to anything you want.

In terminal:
{% highlight bash %}
cd /
cd mnt/my-data
sudo express myapp
{% endhighlight %}

After this install dependencies:

```bash
cd myapp && npm install
```

and run the app:

```bash
DEBUG=myapp ./bin/www
```
